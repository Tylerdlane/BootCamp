# ACC Software Bootcamp - Assesment #1

</center>

## INSTRUCTIONS:

1.  Git clone this `Students_Oct_2023_Reviews` repository to your computer, within your "bootcamp" folder. 
    - You can run the command `ls -a` to ensure you are not currently in a repository (you should see a `.git` folder). You should not clone a repository within a repository since that will cause issues pushing your work up. Find a more appropriate place to clone if that is the case.

2.  Copy the `Assessment_1` folder over to your ACCSoftwareBootcamp repo, so you can edit the contents there and commit/push them for grading.

    For example, get the questions from

    `github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/Students_Oct_2023_Reviews/Assessment_1`

    And push your answers to

    `github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/<YOUR_REPO>/Assessment_1`

3.  This review is open book. You may use online references available to you to answer the questions, subject to restrictions below. You may ask instructors/mentors to point you in the right direction, if you are stuck. Think of this as a typical work environment, where you may ask a mentor to show you the way, but not do the work for you. Do not ask another student.

4. You must write your solution directly in `solution.js` file provided for you. We have provided some example data to use for the code. However, we will also test with other data to verify your code works for all the edge cases.

5.  Please `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` your answers to your private ACCSoftwareBootcamp repository only. Do so as often as you wish, to make sure your answers are backed-up to github.com.

6. 3 parts - Multiple Choice, Short Questions and Fix My Code section are provided. Attempt all three.

## TIME AVAILABLE

1. You have until 1pm on the day of the assessment to push your answers.

2. Most students are able to complete the exam within 4 hours. With that said, do try taking breaks.

3. Your answers after 1 pm until 5 pm will be considered late.  Late submissions will attract a 10% penalty. Hence please push your answers before 1 pm. If you would like to add to your answers, you may do so after 1 pm, but please make sure you have pushed your answers before 1 pm.

## INTEGRITY:

Remember this review is a test of how well prepared you are. You need to learn from this experience. Try to satisfy the spirit of the review. While some of the questions may appear difficult, they CAN be answered with some amount of research, planning and thought. Here are some ground rules and restrictions:

- No sharing of direct or indirect answers, between students.
- Absolutely no sharing of answer code.
- Absolutely no sharing of screens.
- Do not use code generation websites. You may use them in your final projects, but in assessments, please use your own skills and the use of references like W3Schools and MDN only.
- No sharing of url references, your peers can web search too ;-).
- Any clarification from instructors should be posted on Slack under the channel **#assessments** such that all students have access to the same clarification.

## EVALUATION

1. 70% of overall score is needed for being considered as successful.

1. Multiple choice questions comprise 30%, short questions comprise 50% and fix my code attracts 20% of your midterm score.
