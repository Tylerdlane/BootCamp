## Question 

Using JavaScript, we need to return answers as shown in the examples below.

For example,
```javascript
Example 1: 
[ 1,  true,  -2,  false,
  "konnichewa",  "welcome",  true,  "hello",
  true,  0, true,  0,
  "NAMASTE",  NaN, "", true ,
  "hi",  true,  546,  true ,
  false, undefined, true,  'hola']

Example 2:
  [true, false, true, false, false]
```
The correct answers are:

Example 1:  17 from 24 elements.

Example 2:   2 from 5 elements.

Hint: What do 2 of the 5 elements in Example 2 have in common? What do 17 of the 24 elements in Example 1 have in common? Make the return statment dynamic ( __ from __ elements.) and try using other arrays to test. Don't forget to check for bad values like null/undefined.
