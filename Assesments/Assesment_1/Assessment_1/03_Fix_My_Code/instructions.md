## INSTRUCTIONS:

This is a complete code of the Form validation exercise that was done in class.
Since it is not your code, it is done a bit differently. However it doesn't
work as expected. 

1. Please test it and fix it so it works as expected (50% of the grade). Place comments which show the logic of your fix.

2. Please place comments in it so that the logic is understandable (50% of the grade).


## Good coding!!
