For testing these questions you may access the class server database using Studio 3T.

## Problem

You are building a social media platform that allows users to post messages and follow other users. 
Each message has a title, content, and a timestamp. 
Each user has a username, a list of followers, and a list of messages they have posted.

Your task is to design a MongoDB schema for this platform and write queries using MongooseJS to perform the following operations:

1. Insert a new user with a given username.

2. Insert a new message with a given title, content, and timestamp, and associate it with a given user.

3. Retrieve all messages posted by a given user, sorted by timestamp in descending order.
