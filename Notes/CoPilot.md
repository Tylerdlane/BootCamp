Comment Driven Development - PAIR PROGRAMMING

PROMPT ENGINEERING
a. Context - what tabs are open 
b. Intent
c. Clarity
d. Specificity


STEPS:

1. Write your goal down ... few lines of code and comments will give you sufficient context on what your building
2. Flexible: Rephrase your prompt if needed because Copilot is not deterministic, it is probablistic
3. Provide Examples - this will help you understand the problem better


REMEMBER:

1. Good code begets good code
  - name thing properly
    e.g. name the id of the object as id, not as x. better to name it requestedId, changedId, etc.
2. Follow best practices

function(timeOfRequest = '', personmakingRequest) {
    var requestedId;
    var changedId = 0;
}
3. Open Reperesntative Examples in tabs
