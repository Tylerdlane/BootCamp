## Project: Fruit Gallery
<hr>
You are given 9 images and you must create a simple image gallery. Easy, right? Well, the challenge here is that the image gallery must be responsive- meaning it resizes itself when the browser window gets smaller.

### Preview

* This is a preview of how the image gallery should look on a full size browser on a laptop:
 <p align="center">
   <img src="./assets/AgBa9pm.png" width=75% style="margin-left:5%">
 </p>
* This is how the image gallery should look on a medium size browser on a tablet:
 <p align="center"> 
   <img src="./assets\eK6AhTx.png" width=50% style="margin">
 </p>
* This is how the image gallery should look on a small size browser on a phone:
  <p align="center"> 
    <img src="./assets\QGRguil.png" width=25% style="margin">
  </p>
  
Hint: Use flexbox.

### Images

The images are in the `assets` folder. They have already been linked in the `index.html` file.
